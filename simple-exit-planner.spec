concept SimpleDynamicExitPlanner

purpose
    provide intelligent, context-aware exit strategies and alternative return routes during active hikes using AI-powered analysis and personalized recommendations, with fallback to manual operations when AI is unavailable

principle
    as users progress along a hike, the system continuously monitors their location, physical state, environmental conditions, and personal preferences using AI to provide highly personalized exit strategies. The AI analyzes user behavior patterns, current conditions, and historical data to suggest optimal return routes that account for individual capabilities, preferences, and real-time circumstances. The system can operate without AI assistance by falling back to rule-based recommendations and manual operations, but with AI augmentation provides significantly more intelligent and personalized guidance.

state
    a set of ActiveHikes with
        a user User
        a route PlannedRoute
        a startTime Date
        a currentLocation Location
        an isActive Boolean

    a set of ExitPoints with
        a name String
        a location Location
        an accessibility String // 'easy', 'moderate', 'difficult'
        a distanceFromCurrent Number // in miles

    a set of ExitStrategies with
        an exitPoint ExitPoint
        an estimatedArrivalTime Date
        a confidenceScore Number // 0-1
        a reasoning String

    a set of UserProfiles with
        a userId String
        an averagePace Number // mph
        a maxDistance Number // miles
        a riskTolerance String // 'conservative', 'moderate', 'adventurous'
        a weatherSensitivity String // 'low', 'medium', 'high'

    a set of ContextualFactors with
        weather WeatherConditions
        trailConditions TrailConditions
        userFatigue FatigueIndicators

    a set of UserFeedback with
        a hikeId String
        an exitStrategyId String
        a satisfaction Number // 1-5
        an accuracy Number // 1-5
        a helpfulness Number // 1-5
        comments String

    invariants
        each active hike has a valid user and route
        each exit strategy references a valid exit point
        confidence scores are between 0 and 1
        all locations have valid coordinates
        user profiles contain valid preference data

actions
    startHike(route: PlannedRoute, user: User): ActiveHike
        requires route is valid and user is not already on an active hike
        effect creates new ActiveHike with current location set to trailhead, start time recorded, and initializes context for personalized monitoring

    updateLocation(hike: ActiveHike, newLocation: Location): ActiveHike
        requires hike is active and newLocation is valid
        effect updates hike's current location, recalculates available exit strategies based on new position, and triggers AI analysis of user progress patterns

    getExitStrategies(hike: ActiveHike): ExitStrategy[]
        requires hike is active
        effect returns set of possible exit strategies from current location, including estimated arrival times, with AI-powered ranking based on user profile and current conditions, or fallback to rule-based recommendations

    endHike(hike: ActiveHike, exitPoint: ExitPoint): CompletedHike
        requires hike is active and exitPoint is valid
        effect marks hike as completed, records end time and exit point, returns completed hike record, and updates user profile with learned preferences and capabilities

    generatePersonalizedRecommendations(hike: ActiveHike, userProfile: UserProfile, contextualFactors: ContextualFactors): ExitStrategy[]
        requires hike is active, userProfile exists, and contextualFactors are current
        effect uses LLM to analyze user's hiking history, current physical state, environmental conditions, and personal preferences to generate highly personalized exit strategy recommendations with detailed reasoning

    analyzeUserState(hike: ActiveHike, sensorData: Map): UserState
        requires hike is active and sensorData contains valid measurements
        effect uses AI to interpret user's physical state (fatigue, pace, heart rate if available) and environmental factors to assess readiness to continue or need for exit

    provideContextualGuidance(hike: ActiveHike, userQuery: String): String
        requires hike is active and userQuery is a natural language question or concern
        effect uses LLM to provide personalized, contextual advice about current hiking situation, exit options, safety considerations, and recommendations based on user's specific circumstances

    learnFromUserFeedback(hike: ActiveHike, feedback: UserFeedback): UserProfile
        requires hike is completed and feedback contains user's experience with recommended exit strategies
        effect uses AI to analyze user feedback and update user profile with learned preferences, improving future recommendations

    addUserProfile(profile: UserProfile): void
        requires profile contains valid user data
        effect adds user profile to system for personalized recommendations

    addExitPoint(exitPoint: ExitPoint): void
        requires exitPoint has valid location and accessibility data
        effect adds exit point to available options for recommendations

notes
    This AI-augmented concept demonstrates how LLM integration can enhance a basic exit planning system with intelligent, personalized recommendations. The system learns from user behavior and feedback to provide increasingly accurate and helpful guidance over time. The design preserves original functionality by providing fallback mechanisms when AI is unavailable, ensuring the system remains functional in all scenarios.
